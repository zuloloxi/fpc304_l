<descr>
This chapter describes the <file>printer</file> unit for Free Pascal. It was written for
DOS by Florian Klaempfl, and it was written for Linux by Michael Van 
Canneyt, and has been ported to Windows and OS/2 as well. 
Its basic functionality is the same for all supported systems, although there 
are minor differences on Linux and UNIX.

<short>Default printing file.</short>
<descr>
<var>Lst</var> is the standard printing device. <br/> On Linux,

<element name="AssignLst">
<short>Assign text file to printing device</short>
<descr>
<p>
<var>AssignLst</var> assigns to <var>F</var> a printing device - <em>UNIX only</em>.
<var>ToFile</var> is a string with the following form:
</p>
<ul>
<li><var>'|filename options'</var>: This sets up a pipe with the program filename,
with the given options, such as in the popen() call.
</li>
<li><var>'filename'</var>: Prints to file filename. Filename can contain the string 'PID'
(No Quotes), which will be replaced by the PID of your program.
When closing lst, the file will be sent to lpr and deleted. (lpr should be in PATH)
</li>
<li><var>{'filename|'}</var>: Same as previous, only the file is <em>not</em> sent to lpr, nor is it
deleted.  (useful for opening /dev/printer or for later printing)
</li>
</ul>
