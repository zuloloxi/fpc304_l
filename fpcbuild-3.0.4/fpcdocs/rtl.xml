<short>Free Pascal Run-Time Library</short>
<descr>
<p>
The Run-Time Library is the basis of all Free Pascal programs.
It contains the basic units that most programs will use, and are made
available on all platforms supported by Free pascal (well, more or less).
</p>
<p>
There are units for compatibility with the Turbo Pascal Run-Time 
library, and there are units for compatibility with Delphi.
</p>
<p>
On top of these two sets, there are also a series of units to handle
keyboard/mouse and text screens in a cross-platform way.
</p>
<p>
Other units include platform specific units that implement the specifics
of a platform, these are usually needed to support the Turbo Pascal or 
Delphi units. 
</p> 
<p>
Units that fall outside the above outline do not belong in the RTL, but
should be included in the packages, or in the FCL.
