<module name="sharemem">
<short>Shared memory memory manager (windows)</short>
<descr>
<p>
<var>sharemem</var> implements a shared memory manager. Including this unit
will replace the standard memory manager with a memory manager which uses
shared memory. This means the memory allocated by this unit can be managed
by a program and a DLL if they both use the shared memory manager: it
allows, amongst other things, to pass ansistrings or unicode strings from a
program to a DLL and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
This unit does not implement any routines: all actions to replace the memory
manager are performed in the initialization section of the unit. The unit
should be placed as the first unit in a program or DLL's uses section,
memory corruption may occur if the unit is not placed first.
</p>
<p>
This unit requires the <file>fpcmemdll.dll</file> library to be distributed
with both program and dll that use this unit. This DLL is distributed with
the windows Free Pascal distribution.
