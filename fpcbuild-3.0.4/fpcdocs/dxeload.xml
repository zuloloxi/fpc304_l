<package name="rtl">
<module name="dxeload">
<short>Load DXE file in to memory</short>
<descr>
<p>
The <file>dxeload</file> unit was implemented by Pierre Mueller for dos,
it allows to load a DXE file (an object file with 1 entry point)
into memory and return a pointer to the entry point.
</p>
<p>
It exists only for dos.
</p>
</descr>

<element name="DXE_MAGIC">
<short>Magic number, found in the header of a DXE file.</short>>
</element>

<element name="dxe_header">
<short>Record with header of DXE file</short>
<descr>
The <var>dxe_header</var> record describes the header of a DXE file. It is used to
determine the magic number of the DXE file and number of relocations that 
must be done when the object file is loaded in memory.
</descr>
</element>

<element name="dxe_load">
<short>Load DXE file in memory</short>
<descr>
<p>
<var>dxe_load</var> loads the contents of the file <var>filename</var> into memory.
It performs the necessary relocations in the object code, and returns then
a pointer to the entry point of the code.
</p>
<p>
For an example, see the <link id="#rtl.emu387">emu387</link> unit in the RTL.
</p>
