<module name="clocale">
<short>Initialize internationalization settings from the C library</short>
<descr>
<p>
The <var>clocale</var> offers no API by itself: it just initializes the
internationalization settings of the <link id="#rtl.sysutils">sysutils</link>
unit with the values provided by the C library found on most Unix or Linux
systems that are POSIX compliant.
</p>
<p>
The <file>clocale</file> should simply be included in the uses clause of the
program, preferably as one of the first units, and the initialization
section of the unit will do all the work.
</p>
<p>
Note that including this unit, links your program to the C library of the
system.
</p>
<p>
It makes no sense to use this unit on a non-posix system: Windows, OS/2 or
DOS - therefore it should always be between an ifdef statement:
</p>
<code>
program myprogram;

uses 
  {$ifdef unix}clocale{$endif},
   classes, sysutils;
</code>
