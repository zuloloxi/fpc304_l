\section*{About this guide}
This document describes all constants, types, variables, functions and
procedures as they are declared in the units that come standard with the 
Free Pascal Run-Time library (RTL).

Throughout this document, we will refer to functions, types and variables
with \var{typewriter} font. Functions and procedures gave their own
subsections, and for each function or procedure we have the following
topics:
\begin{description}
\item [Declaration] The exact declaration of the function.
\item [Description] What does the procedure exactly do ?
\item [Errors] What errors can occur.
\item [See Also] Cross references to other related functions/commands.
\end{description}
