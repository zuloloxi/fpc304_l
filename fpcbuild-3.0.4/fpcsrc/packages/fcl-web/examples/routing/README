This demo demonstrates the routing mechanism of fpWeb.

It can be run as a CGI or as a HTTP standalone server program.

In order to get a correct set of routes in the demo, demorouting.ini file
must be configured correctly and placed next to the binary.

There is a different section for each type of binary: (CGI or Standalone)

Each section needs at least the BaseURL key, this is the URL where the
application can be reached.

Example:

[CGI]
; Assuming the demo is in cgi-bin
BaseURL=http://localhost/cgi-bin/demorouting.cgi

[Standalone]
Port=8080
; Optional, the following is the default.
;BaseURL=http://localhost:8080/
